# Overview

- An array is a linear [](https://www.simplilearn.com/data-structures-and-algorithms-article)data structure that collects elements of the same data type and stores them in contiguous and adjacent memory locations.
- Arrays work on an index system starting from $0$ to $n - 1$, where $n$ is the size of the array.

- There are 2 types of arrays - this is based on how they are allocated in memory:
    - Static arrays:
        - Memory is allocated at compile time.
        - Size is fixed.
        - In Java, the static array is the primitive type called **array**.
    - Dynamic arrays:
        - Memory is allocated at runtime.
        - Size is not fixed.
        - In Java, the dynamic array is represented by the `ArrayList` class in the [Javaâ€™s Collections Framework](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_collections.asp).
